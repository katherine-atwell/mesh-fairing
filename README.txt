This assignment involves performing mesh fairing in order to smooth a 3-D image comprised of many different triangles. It also uses readObjFile() and WriteObjFile() from io.cpp in order to parse and write to .obj files.

I received no help on this assignment other than psuedocode discussed in class and the research paper provided.

To run, do ./proj4 input.obj output.obj stepsize niterations
